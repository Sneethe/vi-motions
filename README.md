# More Vi Motions

Add more Vi Motions

## Motions added:


_Distributed with Zsh, enabled here:_

- Select quoted strings/tokens (`'`, `"`, or `\``) as text objects
with `a` or `i` commands.
- Select bracketed strings/tokens (`( )`, `{ }`, `[ ]`, or `< >`) as text objects
with `a` or `i` commands.
- Change/delete surrounding quotes/brackets as in vim-surround.

_Distributed with this plugin, not enabled:_

- Change `W`, `B`, `E`, and `gE` motions to work on shell words
rather than blank words.
(See the end of `motions.zsh` for how to enable this.)
